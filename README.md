SANzone

by Bobby Watson

-----------------

SANzone is a script to pull HBA info from UCS Manager and generate SAN zone configuration for Cisco MDS switches.

SSH implementation is planned for future revisions, as well as the ability to connect to multiple UCS Managers.

Tweaking will definitely be required if you want to use this for your own environment.
